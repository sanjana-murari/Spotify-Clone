# Spotify-Clone
This project is a simple web-based Spotify clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a basic music player interface where users can play, pause, and switch between songs from a predefined playlist. The design includes a navigation bar, a visually styled song list, and a control panel with a seek bar and playback buttons (play, pause, next, previous). The JavaScript handles the audio playback logic, updates the UI in real-time, and manages events like switching tracks and updating the song name and cover image. The layout is styled using custom CSS along with Google Fonts (Ubuntu and Varela Round) and Font Awesome icons for controls. All audio files and cover images must be placed in the respective songs/ and covers/ folders for the player to function properly. This is a front-end only project, ideal for learning DOM manipulation and basic media handling in JavaScript.
